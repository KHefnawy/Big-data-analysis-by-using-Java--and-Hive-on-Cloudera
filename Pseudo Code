Pseudo code for map 1 
1) take the input line by line 
2) split the line into tokens by delimiter “,”
3) iterate over the tokens and increment a counter by 1 every time 
4) if counter == 1 store value of x
		X = ciel (x) 
    if counter == 2 store value of y
                         y = ciel (y) 
   if  counter == 5 store value of the place_ID 
      write to the output of the map (x+”_” + y+”,”place_ID, 1);
Pseudo code for reduce 1 
1) For the same square_ID and place_ID 
 Sum their values 


Pseudo code for map 1 
1) take the output of the first map reduce line by line 
2) split the line into tokens by delimiter “/t”
3) write to the output of the map (square_ID, place_ID,Sum)
Pseudo code for reduce 1 
1) For the same square_ID 
2) split the value to sum and place_ID 
3) find the max Sum 
4) update  bestPlace = place_ID
